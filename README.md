# CARDIAC Project

This is a projecto to createa virtual machine bassed on the famous CARDIAC that was designed in 1968 in the Bell Labs by David Hagelbarger and Saul Fingerman to explain how a computer
works to people that doesn't have a computer. No the focus is a little different different, the computers have evolved, so its necesarry to have a model to explain how the
new concurrent and parallel computers work in a simple way.

This project has three virtual machines, the first is the original model, but in software instead of paper, the secodn is the concurrent machine and the third is the parallel machine.
